Release Notes for Firecookie 0.7
--------------------------------

== Enhancements ==
    * Cookies panel now supports activation just like Console, Script and Net 
      panels in Firebug. So, it's possible to disable the panel entirely or for 
      specific hosts (issue 15).
    * The console cookie event displays a source URL (as a tooltip for the domain
      link on the right side), which causes the cookie modification. Of course,
      "Cookies->Options->Show logs in console" option must be on to see it (issue 5)
    * The "Remove for site" toolbar button has been renamed to "Remove Cookies".
      This action always removes only cookies currently displayed in the list (Issue 10).
      Notice that the list can be filtered using:
      (a) The Filter toolbar button.
      (b) The Firebug's search box (located on the right side of the FB tab bar).
    * Support for HttpOnly cookies. There is a new column indicating whether a cookie
      is HttpOnly or not and the Edit Cookie dialog makes possible to change this flag.
      Also clipboard has been updated to support it (issue 14).

=== Cookie Expire Time ===
    * Expire time is now displayed using the local time zone and locale.
    * The Edit Cookie dialog uses date and time pickers so, editing also
      supports local time zone and current language. This is available
      only for Firefox 3 and higher (issue 6).
